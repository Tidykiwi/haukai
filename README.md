Haukai Restaurant Project - BIT607 Assignment2

This repository contains the code for Open Polytechnic BIT607 Assignment 2. The instructions for the asignment are:

Your first task is to develop a web application locally using VS Code that implements the 
information architecture you defined in Assignment 1.
You will need to demonstrate your understanding of the requirements for valid HTML5, accessibility 
standards, and writing a privacy statement for a web application (Learning Outcome 4), as well as 
your ability to implement responsive design, and further optimise the application by using a range of 
tools and techniques (Learning Outcome 5).
This assessment also requires you to find images; please respect the copyright of image owners 
and choose images which are free to use. From Google images, go to Tools>usage> free to use.
At a minimum, ensure you have the following pages and content:
• home (image of restaurant)
• contact (map)
• hours (calendar)
• menu (food and drink with illustrative images)
• reservations (with a form to allow reservations to be taken).

For any dynamic content use Google maps, forms, and calendar.

To demonstrate achievement of Learning Outcome 4, your completed web application should 
meet the following requirements:
(a) Use valid HTML5 to implement web page headers, footers, content and
navigation between the web pages.
(b) Formatting should be controlled from a separated and linked CSS file
created using CSS3 standards.
(c) Follow accessibility guidelines where appropriate.
(d) Provide an appropriate privacy statement. This can be provided on the
home page, or a navigation link to a separate page. Make sure you
consider what data is being collected, the method of collection, the
purpose for collection, whether it’s shared, and the means for correcting
errors.

To demonstrate achievement of Learning Outcome 5, your completed web application should 
meet the following requirements:
(e) Apply responsive design principles to make the web application mobileready. Ensure the viewport is configured to allow the browser to adjust
page dimensions and scaling will suit the different device sizes, and
that pages can be easily resized by the user with no reliance on fixedwidth viewports. Images should also scale appropriately, or alternative
images provided for smaller viewports. Fonts should be legible for mobile
visitors without any need to ‘pinch and zoom’.
(f) Optimise page loading times with the aim that the home page can be
loaded within 2 seconds on a 2G network. All other pages should have
their performan optimised as much as possible using appropriate
techniques.
