Haukai Restaurant Project

This repository contains the code for a project completed as part of studying 'BIT607 - Web Development' at
the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand (BIT = Bachelor of Information Technology).

The project required me to have the following pages and content:<br>
  • home (image of restaurant)<br>
  • contact (map)<br>
  • hours (calendar)<br>
  • menu (food and drink with illustrative images)<br>
  • reservations (with a form to allow reservations to be taken)<br>
  • staff roster (private page protected by .htaccess<br>

The project required me to display an understanding of:<br>
  • The requirements for valid HTML 5<br>
  • Implementing responsive design<br>
  • Accessability standards<br>
  • Optimising the application using a range of tools and techniques<br>
  • Writing a privacy statement<br>

More detailed requirements are as follows:<br>

(a) Use valid HTML5 to implement web page headers, footers, content and
navigation between the web pages.<br>
(b) Formatting should be controlled from a separated and linked CSS file
created using CSS3 standards.<br>
(c) Create a private page for roster details and staff contact information
that is protected using a .htaccess configuration file.<br>
(d) Follow accessibility guidelines where appropriate.<br>
(e) Provide an appropriate privacy statement. This can be provided on the
home page, or a navigation link to a separate page. Make sure you
consider what data is being collected, the method of collection, the
purpose for collection, whether it’s shared, and the means for correcting
errors.<br>
(f) Apply responsive design principles to make the web application mobile-ready. 
Ensure the viewport is configured to allow the browser to adjust
page dimensions and scaling will suit the different device sizes, and
that pages can be easily resized by the user with no reliance on fixed-width viewports. 
Images should also scale appropriately, or alternative
images provided for smaller viewports. Fonts should be legible for mobile
visitors without any need to ‘pinch and zoom’.<br>
(g) Optimise page loading times with the aim that the home page can be
loaded within 2 seconds on a 2G network. All other pages should have
their performan optimised as much as possible using appropriate
techniques.<br>
